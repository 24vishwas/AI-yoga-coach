## AI Yoga Coach

The AI Yoga Coach is a project that combines the power of deep learning and React.js to create an interactive yoga coaching application. It utilizes TensorFlow's PoseNet library to extract key data points from users' yoga poses, allowing for real-time feedback and guidance.

## Features

- Real-time Pose Detection: The AI Yoga Coach uses TensorFlow's PoseNet model to accurately detect and track users' yoga poses in real-time. This allows for precise analysis of posture and alignment.

- Interactive Feedback: With the help of deep learning algorithms, the AI Yoga Coach provides instant feedback on users' yoga poses. It identifies common mistakes and suggests corrections, helping users improve their form and technique.

- Personalized Training: The application adapts to individual users by leveraging deep learning techniques. It learns from each user's movements and progress, tailoring future coaching sessions to their specific needs and goals.

- User-Friendly Interface: The AI Yoga Coach features a sleek and intuitive user interface built with React.js. The interface provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the application, view their progress, and access instructional resources.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: The frontend of the AI Yoga Coach is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js enables the creation of interactive and dynamic components that enhance the user experience.

- TensorFlow: TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, powers the deep learning capabilities of the AI Yoga Coach. It enables training and testing of the pose estimation model using PoseNet, allowing for accurate detection of yoga poses.

- PoseNet: The AI Yoga Coach utilizes TensorFlow's PoseNet, a pre-trained deep learning model specifically designed for pose estimation. It accurately estimates the locations of key body joints and provides valuable data points for analysis.
